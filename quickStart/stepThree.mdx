<Tip>
  **Prerequisite:** You should have connected Stripe before starting. More info
  [here](/stripe)
</Tip>

## Step One: Place Embeded Code

```bash
<script src="https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/add_experiment?workspace_id=YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" defer ></script>
```

The script needs to be added on your landing page, app, or any other page where you want to use 1Price. This script will add a global variable called `1Price` to your window object which will categorize new users.. You can find your unique `workspace_id` on the [connect page](https://app.1price.co/connect)

## Step Two: Dynamic Price Number

<ParamField></ParamField>

```bash
fetch("https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/price_value", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        cookies: document.cookie,
    }),
    credentials: "include",
})
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("Products", data)
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error)
    })
```

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
