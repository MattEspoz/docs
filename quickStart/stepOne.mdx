## Copy & Paste Embeded Code

Insert our script tag in your website's head tag.

```bash
<script src="https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/add_experiment?workspace_id=YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" defer ></script>
```

The script needs to be added on your landing page, app, or any other page where you want to use 1Price. This script will add a global variable called `1Price` to your window object which will categorize new users.

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` with your unique `workspace_id` found on
  [connect](https://app.1price.co/connect)
</Warning>

## Adding Scripts to Apps

Each app has their own unique way to add a script to the `<Head>` tag. The following are personalized guides to integrate with the following apps.
