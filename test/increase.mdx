The following is a guide on how to use 1Price to do price increase experiments.

<Warning> **[VIDEO MISSING]**</Warning>

### Experiment Reasoning

> Most founders drastically **underprice** their products. In most cases, you can price your product 200% higher while maintaining the same influx of customers. <br/> <br/> By using 1Price to do price experiments, you can confidently optimize your price to a select cohort of users then analyze the results.

### Step 1: Create New Price

Login to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard). Navigate to [Product Catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) then select the Product you want to add a new price to.

</Frame>

<Note>
  You can currently only create a new price on Stripe Dashboard. In the near
  future, you will be able to create Stripe prices to test on your behalf.
</Note>

Then import the newly created price from the [Import Page](https://app.1price.co/import)

### Step 2: Update Plan & Offer

Build or update a [Plan](/build/plans) that links to the newly imported price.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/PlanIncrease.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Then, create a new [Offer](/build/offers) that includes the Plan.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/OfferIncrease.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

### Step 3: Start Experiment

Build a new [Experiment](/build/firstExp) comparing the two Offers.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/StartExperiment.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Finally, start the experiment and see the [Results](/build/results) after 24 hours.

<Warning>
  Ensure the [integration](/build/code) is correctly setup before analyzing the
  experiment results.
