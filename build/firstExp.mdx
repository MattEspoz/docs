The 1Price platform allows you to create Experiments that compare two [Offerings](/build/offers)
against each other. Experiments are able to have data-driven [Results](/build/results)
that determine the better Offering.

### Experiment Configurations

After setting up your [Offerings](/build/offers) and adding them to an [Experiment](/build/experiment), 1Price will then randomly assign users to a cohort where they will only see only one of the two Offerings.

    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}

Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab and choose **+ New** then fill in the Experiment Name, Control Offering, Treatment Offering, and the size of the Audience Set. Once you've entered this information, click **Create Experiment**.

### Required Fields

<ParamField path="Experiment Name" type="string" required>
  The name of the experiment
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Control Offering" type="offer" required>
  The offering that will be used as the Control group
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Treatment Offering" type="offer" required>
  The offering that will be selected as the Treatment group
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Audience Set" type="percent" required>
  The % of new customers that will be exposed to the price experiment
</ParamField>

<Tip>
  You can modify the % of new customers to enroll in 10% increments based on how
  much of your audience you want to expose to the test. Keep in mind that the
  enrolled new customers will be split between the two variants, so a test that
  enrolls 10% of new customers would yield 5% in the Control group and 5% in the
  Treatment group.

### FAQs

**Can I edit the Offerings in a started experiment?**

Editing an Offering for an active experiment would make the results unusable. Be sure to check before starting your experiment that your chosen Offerings render correctly in your app(s). If you need to make a change to your Offerings, stop the experiment and create a new one with the updated Offerings.
