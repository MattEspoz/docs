The 1Price platform allows you to create Experiments that compare two [Offerings](/build/offers)
against each other. Experiments are able to have data-driven [Results](/build/results)
that determine the better Offering.

### Experiment Configurations

After setting up your [Offerings](/build/offers) and adding them to an [Experiment](/build/experiment), 1Price will then randomly assign users to a cohort where they will only see only one of the two Offerings
