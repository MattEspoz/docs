The 1Price platform allows you to create Experiments that compare two [Offerings](/build/offers)
against each other. Experiments are able to have data-driven [Results](/build/results)
that determine the better Offering.

### Experiment Configurations

After setting up your [Offerings](/build/offers) and adding them to an [Experiment](/build/experiment), 1Price will then randomly assign users to a cohort where they will only see only one of the two Offerings.

Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab and choose **+ New** then fill in the Experiment Name, Control Offering, Treatment Offering, and the size of the Audience Set. Once you've entered this information, click **Create Experiment**.

  Users are assigned to different cohorts based on the size of the `audience set`

### Required Fields

<ParamField path="Experiment Name" type="string" required>
  The name of the experiment
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Control Offering" type="offer" required>
  The offering that will be used as the Control group
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Treatment Offering" type="offer" required>
  The offering that will be selected as the Treatment group
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Audience Set" type="percent" required>
  The % of new customers that will be exposed to the price experiment
</ParamField>

<Tip>
  You can increase the audience set in 10% increments based on how much of your
  audience you want to be exposed to the test. Notably, the test is split evenly
  based on both offerings -- for instance, a test that enrolls 10% Audience Set
  would be 5% Control Offering and 5% Treatment Offering.

### FAQs

**Can I edit the Offerings in a started experiment?**

You can edit an Offering for an active experiment, but just know that would make the results unusable. If you need to make a change to your Offerings, stop the experiment and create a new one with the updated Offerings.

**Can I run multiple experiments simultaneously?**

At the moment you can't. For early access request it [here](mailto:hello@1price.co)

**Can I add more than two offers to an experiment?**

No, as adding more offers will dilute the results of the experiment. Instead try adding multiple experiments simultaneously to achieve the same result.

**Can I edit any details after starting experiment?**

Before an experiment has been started, all aspects can be edited. However, once an experiment has been started, no details of the experiment can be changed.

**Can I restart an experiment after it's been stopped?**

After you choose to stop an experiment, new customers will no longer be enrolled in it, and it cannot be restarted. If you want to continue a test, create a new experiment and choose the same Offerings as the stopped experiment.

**What happens to customers that were enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped?**

New customers will no longer be enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped, and customers who were already enrolled in the experiment will begin receiving the `Default Offering` if they reach a paywall again.
