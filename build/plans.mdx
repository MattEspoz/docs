The 1Price platform allows you to create unique 'tiers' or 'plans' that allow for full customization for experiments. You create plans for monthly plans, yearly plans, and one-time deals.

### Plan Configurations

After you've imported your products from Stripe you need to have a 1-to-1 mapping of the product to their plan types. For instance, you can create a new plan called 'Growth Tier' where you link one Product for the monthly mapping, and another Product for the yearly mapping.

Navigate to the **Plan** tab and choose **+ New** then fill in the identifier, description, and corresponding products.

<Info>
  The identifier must be unique as it be used later for during API calls.

  You can also map particular Stripe productIds with their corresponding original
  productIds. This is useful if you use external tools or have a complex backend
  system.{" "}
