<Tip>
  **Prerequisite:** You should have connected Stripe before starting. More info
  [here](/quickStart#2-connect-stripe-1-min)
</Tip>

<Note>
  We have created personalized guides to integrate with the following apps:
  [React/Nextjs](/integrations/react), [Framer](/integrations/framer),
  [Webflow](/integrations/webflow), [Wordpress](/integrations/wordpress),
  [Gumroad]((/integrations/gumroad)).
</Note>

## Step One: Copy Embeded Code

Insert our script tag in your website's head tag.

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<script
  src="https://widget.1price.co/script.js"
  data-1p="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"
  defer
></script>
```

```javascript Next.js
"use client"; // NextJS 13 requires this. Remove if you are using NextJS 12 or lower.

import Script from "next/script";

const YourComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Script
      src="https://widget.1price.co/script.js"
      data-1p="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" // Required
    ></Script>
  );
};
```

</CodeGroup>

The script needs to be added on your landing page, app, or any other page where you want to use 1Price. This script will add a global variable called `$1Price` to your window object which will categorize new users.

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` with your unique `data_1p` found on
  [connect](https://app.1price.co/connect)
</Warning>

## Step Two: Dynamic Price Number

To have adaptive pricing, change the price value to correspond with the [1Price Experiment](/build/firstExp). This value will be used during pricing tables within the app and landing page.

<Tip>
  For comprehensive tests, check out our [interactive
  playground](/api-reference/introduction).
</Tip>

```javascript POST
fetch("https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/price_value", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    offerId: $1Price.offer_id,
    workspaceId: $1Price.workspace_id,
    customerId: $1Price.customer_id,
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Products", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

This endpoint returns a **JSON object containing pricing details** for your products, including monthly and yearly pricing options, features, and currency information. The response includes:

`Success Status`

`Currency`

`Product Details`

Use this data to dynamically populate your pricing table and ensure your visitors always see the most up-to-date pricing information.

<ParamField path="Offer Name" type="string" required>
  The name of the offer
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="Plan Selection" type="plan" required>
  The plans that are linked to your offer.
</ParamField>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample Response" icon="code" iconType="solid">
  <CodeGroup>
   ```javascript Success Message
{
 "success": true,
 "currency": "USD",
 "products": [
   {
     "name": "Basic Plan",
     "monthly": {
       "price": 9.99,
       "interval": "month",
       "interval_count": 1,
       "stripe_price_id": "price_1ABC123XYZ"
      },
     "yearly": {
       "price": 99.99,
       "interval": "year",
       "interval_count": 1,
       "stripe_price_id": "price_2DEF456UVW"
      },
     "features": [
       "Feature 1",
       "Feature 2",
       "Feature 3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript Failure Message
{
 "success": false,
}
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step Three: Track Purchases

To determine the success of a experiment, we track multiple data points on [Results](/build/results). Simply add a `1price_cid` to your Stripe Checkout Session

You'll need to send the 1Price generated priceId to your backend server when creating a stripe subscription.

```javascript Example Stripe Subscription
const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
customer: 'cus_Mzbketpctz1F',
metadata: { 1price_cid: req.body.priceId, },
items: [
{price: 'price_1MFMsUToeCS20juA2Y'},
],
});

```

```javascript Example Stripe Checkout Session
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  cancel_url: "https://example.com/cancel",
  metadata: { 1Price_cid: req.body.1Price },
  line_items: [{ price: "price_H5vtDq1fbrJ", quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
});
```

<Note>
  Example above is with Javascript, but it is the same with every language. You
  just need to send the 1Price ID from client side to your backend server either
  with params, query, or body and then send it to Stripe with metadata when a
  stripe checkout session.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If the Stripe API is called on the client side, you will need to use the
  1Price Global variation from either `$1Price` or `window.$1Price`
