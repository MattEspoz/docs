<Tip>
  **Prerequisite:** You should have connected Stripe before starting. More info
  [here](/quickStart#2-connect-stripe-1-min)
</Tip>

<Note>
  We have created personalized guides to integrate with the following apps:
  [React/Nextjs](/integrations/react), [Framer](/integrations/framer),
  [Webflow](/integrations/webflow), [Wordpress](/integrations/wordpress),
  [Gumroad](/integrations/gumroad).
</Note>
<Warning>
  Ensure you have started an experiment to the status `In Progress` before
  following the guide

</Tip>

## Step One: Copy Embeded Code

Insert our script tag in your website's head tag.

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<script
  src="https://widget.1price.co/script.js"
  data-1p="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"
  defer
></script>
```

```javascript Next.js
"use client"; // NextJS 13 requires this. Remove if you are using NextJS 12 or lower.

import Script from "next/script";

const YourComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Script
      src="https://widget.1price.co/script.js"
      data-1p="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" // Required
    ></Script>
  );
};
```

</CodeGroup>

The script needs to be added on your landing page, app, or any other page where you want to use 1Price. This script will add a global variable called `$1Price` to your window object which will categorize new users.

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` with your unique `data_1p` found on
  [connect](https://app.1price.co/connect)
</Warning>

## Step Two: Dynamic Price Number

To have adaptive pricing, change the price value to correspond with the [1Price Experiment](/build/firstExp). This value will be used during pricing tables within the app and landing page.

<Tip>
  For comprehensive tests, check out our [interactive
  playground](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/1price-demo-forked-fwylmj?workspaceId=b5b1c612-c839-4312-b977-a30fb346f3f2).
</Tip>

```javascript POST
fetch("https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/price_value", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    offerId: $1Price.offer_id,
    workspaceId: $1Price.workspace_id,
    customerId: $1Price.customer_id,
    uniqueId: YOUR_UNIQUE_ID, // OPTIONAL
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Products", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_UNIQUE_ID` with the value of your customer_id.
</Warning>

This endpoint returns a **JSON object containing pricing details** for your products, including monthly and yearly pricing options, and currency information. The response includes:

`Success Status`

`Currency`

`Product Details`

Use this data to dynamically populate your pricing table and ensure your visitors always see the most up-to-date pricing information.

<ParamField path="offerId" type="string" required>
  The offer shown for experiments
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="workspaceId" type="string" required>
  The workspace of your account
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="customerId" type="string" required>
  The customer linked to the offer
</ParamField>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample Response" icon="code" iconType="solid">
  <CodeGroup>
   ```javascript Success Message

 "success": true,
 "currency": "usd",
 "products": [

       "price": 99.99,
       "stripe_price_id": "price_2DEF456UVW"
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript Failure Message
{
 "success": false,
}
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step Three: Track Purchases

To determine the success of a experiment, we track multiple data points on [Results](/build/results). Simply add a `oneprice_cid` to your Stripe Checkout Session

You'll need to send the 1Price generated priceId to your backend server when creating a Stripe subscription.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Example Stripe Checkout Session
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  cancel_url: "https://example.com/cancel",
  metadata: { oneprice_cid: YOUR_1PRICE_CID },
  line_items: [{ price: YOUR_PRICE_ID, quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
});
```
```javascript Example Stripe Subscription Session
const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({ 
  customer: 'cus_Mzbketpctz1F', 
  metadata: { oneprice_cid: YOUR_1PRICE_CID },
  items: [
    { price: YOUR_PRICE_ID },
  ],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_1PRICE_CID` with the value of your $1Price.customer_id
  and the value of `YOUR_PRICE_ID` with the dynamic price_id (from your response
  request).
</Warning>

<Note>
  Example above is with Javascript, but it is the same with every language. You
  just need to send the oneprice_cid from client side to your backend server either
  with params, query, or body and then send it to Stripe with metadata when a
  stripe checkout session.

Also note, we can only track Checkout Sessions at the moment. Subscription Creations is in beta. [Message us for access](mailto:hello@1price.co)

</Note>

<Tip>
  If the Stripe API is called on the client side, you will need to use the
  1Price Global variation from either `$1Price` or `window.$1Price`
</Tip>

## ðŸ§ª â€‹{" "} Test Integration:

1. Start an experiment on 1Price <br/>
2. Make a test purchase on your website/app
3. Ensure transaction was tracked on dashboard

> **BONUS:** You can create a 100% off coupon on Stripe and use that code to make the test purchase, so you do not get charged.

### FAQs

**I get error that says `Start an experiment to activate script`**

This errors on the script shows when you have not started an experiment or when there are no 'active' experiments. Simply, start an experiment to the status `In Progress` and the script will activate.

**What is the difference between `data-1p` and `workspace_id`?**

They are the same thing, just two different names for the same value. You can access your workspace from your script with `$1Price.workspace_id`.
