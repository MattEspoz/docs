<Tip>
  **Prerequisite:** You should have connected Stripe before starting. More info
  [here](/quickStart#2-connect-stripe-1-min)
</Tip>

<Note>
  We have created personalized guides to integrate with the following apps:
  [React/Nextjs](/integrations/react), [Framer](/integrations/framer),
  [Webflow](/integrations/webflow), [Wordpress](/integrations/wordpress),
  [Gumroad]((/integrations/gumroad)).
</Note>

## Step One: Copy & Paste Embeded Code

Insert our script tag in your website's head tag.

```javascript
<script
  src="https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/add_experiment?workspace_id=YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" // change Workspace ID
  defer
></script>
```

The script needs to be added on your landing page, app, or any other page where you want to use 1Price. This script will add a global variable called `$1Price` to your window object which will categorize new users.

<Warning>
  Replace value of `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` with your unique `workspace_id` found on
  [connect](https://app.1price.co/connect)
</Warning>

## Step Two: Dynamic Price Number

To have adaptive pricing, change the price value to correspond with the [1Price Experiment](/build/firstExp). This value will be used during pricing tables within the app and landing page.

<Tip>
  For comprehensive tests, check out our [interactive
  playground](/api-reference/introduction).
</Tip>

```javascript POST
fetch("https://widget.1price.co/api/v1/price_value", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    offerId: $1Price.offer_id,
    workspaceId: $1Price.workspace_id,
    customerId: $1Price.customer_id,
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Products", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

This endpoint returns a **JSON object containing pricing details** for your products, including monthly and yearly pricing options, features, and currency information. The response includes:

`Success Status`

`Currency`

`Product Details`

Use this data to dynamically populate your pricing table and ensure your visitors always see the most up-to-date pricing information.

}
```

## Step Three: Track Purchases

To determine the success of a experiment, we track multiple data multiple on the [Results](/build/results).
