These are analytics based on **all experiments** added together since using 1Price experiments.

### Overview Screen

Within each experiment, the initial screen shares details such as `experiment period`, `control group`, and `treatment group`:

### Customer Journey Tables

The customer journey tables act as a comprehensive view of the customer funnel.

For simplicity, we've broken up experiment results into three tables:

1. **Initial Conversion:** for understanding visitors rates as the top of the funnel. Metrics are used as a way to predict future conversion rates.
2. **Paid Conversion:** for understanding how your initial conversion trends are translating into new paying customers.
3. **Revenue:** for understanding the impacts of two others tables on metrics such as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and lifetime value (LTV)

### FAQs

**What happens to customers that were enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped?**

New customers will no longer be enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped, and customers who were already enrolled in the experiment will begin receiving the `Default Offering` if they reach a paywall again.

At the moment, we do not continously track customer behaviours after the experiment has terminated.

**How can I review the individual customers who were enrolled in my experiment?**

We are currently working on a `Get` or `Create Subscriber` endpoint which will be able to help you determine if an individual subscriber was enrolled in an experiment, and can then pass that fact to other destinations like an analytics provider like Amplitude & Mixpanel, or your own internal database.
