### Why Pricing Experiments Are Crucial for Every Company

All the top software companies have done multiple experiments to determine what to best price their products.

If you're not constantly running pricing tests, you are missing out on **potential revenue** and **limiting your companyâ€™s growth potential**.

<Tip>

A monetization experiment isn't simply just increasing a number. It's also figuring out
packaging, new tiers, feature combinations, trial-lengths, usage-based plans, globalized pricing and more all across different customer groups.

### Price Experiment Options

We've worked with tons of software companies to figure out the best experiments to run to boost revenue with pricing.

Here are the most popular experiments that you can currently run on 1Price:

yet possibly reducing conversion rates.

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> **Geographic Pricing:** identify regional
price variations to maximize revenue per region.

percentage (%) you should be giving potential customers to maximize revenue

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> **Adding a New Tier:** to price anchor against
existing ones or share with a select customer group.

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> **Renaming Plans:** having unique naming for
plans such as 'growth' or 'enterprise' to better resonate with your audience.

options such as usage-based pricing or per-seat models

### Why Other A/B Testing Software Doesn't Works

Most A/B testing software is only good for testing conversion rates and fail to capture data such as LTV, CAC and basic customer behaviour after purchase. These tools are typically only good for testing UI and copywriting changes rather than deeper effects of price adjustments.

### How 1Price Works

> We help any software company setup their first pricing experiment in as little as 35 mins.

After setting up your two [Offerings](/build/offers) and adding them to an [Experiment](/build/experiment), 1Price will then randomly assign users to a cohort where they will only see one of the two Offerings

From here we can determine your users' behaviors and analyze the full subscription lifecycle to understand which variant is producing more value for your business.

This completely removes the guesswork and ensures you are optimizing pricing based on data-driven evidence.
