The 1Price platform allows you to create Offers that hold your [Plans](/build/plans). Offers are the way the plans & products are packaged to your customer.

### Offer Configurations

After settings up your [Plans](/build/plans), you can now group your Plans together into an Offering. The differences of these Offers are basic for setting [Experiments](/build/experiment).

Navigate to the **Offer** tab and choose **+ New** then fill in the Offer Name, and select which Plans to link to your Offer. Once you've entered this information, click **Create Offer**.
